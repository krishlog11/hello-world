My name is Krish Log 11 and I have created a sampel repository for a git tutorial as I a saying in the forward line. This repo and its readme is created for a Git Tutorial. And the name of this repo is Hello World with is a default and very often used name.
There is also the step by step tutorial on w3  for new people and for creating this kind of repos.
W3schools has a full tutorial on git and github. I will tell you the steps later.
